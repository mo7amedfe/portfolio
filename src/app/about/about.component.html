            Hi, I'm <span>Mohamed</span>, a <span>Junior Frontend Web Developer</span> with
            <span>2 years of experience</span> specializing in the <span>Angular framework</span>.
            I also have good knowledge of <span>React</span> and a solid understanding of modern web technologies.
        </p>
        <p [ngClass]="{'item-hovered': isHovered}" (mouseenter)="hover()" (mouseleave)="unhover()">
            I studied <span>Computer Science at Cairo University</span>, where I built a strong foundation in
            <span>programming</span>, <span>object-oriented programming (OOP)</span>, and
            <span>data structures and algorithms, primarily using Java</span>.
            Throughout my career, I have worked as a <span>freelancer</span>, building dynamic and responsive web
            applications.
        </p>
        <p [ngClass]="{'item-hovered': isHovered}" (mouseenter)="hover()" (mouseleave)="unhover()">
            While my focus is on frontend development, I also have some experience with
            <span>backend tools like Express and MongoDB</span>, giving me a broader perspective on full-stack development.
            Additionally, I have learned <span>CSS frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap</span>,
            which help me create clean and modern UI designs.
        </p>
    
        <p [ngClass]="{'item-hovered': isHovered}" (mouseenter)="hover()" (mouseleave)="unhover()"><span>Iâ€™m always eager to
                learn new technologies</span> and improve my skills to build better, more efficient web applications.</p>
